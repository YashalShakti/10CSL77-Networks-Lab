PART A â€“ Simulation Exercises

The following experiments shall be conducted using either NS228/OPNET or any other
simulators.

1. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the
queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-
n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant
applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the
number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.

3. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes
and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes(6-10), change error rate and data rate and
compare the throughput.

5. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot
congestion window for different source/destination.

6. Simulate simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and
determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.

PART B

1. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16-bits).

2. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission.

3. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client sending the file name

and the server to send back the contents of the requested file if present.

4. Implement the above program using as message queues or FIFOs as IPC channels.

5. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.

6. Write a program for congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm.
